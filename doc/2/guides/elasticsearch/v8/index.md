# Elasticsearch 8 support

<SinceBadge version="2.30.0"/>

Kuzzle uses Elasticsearch as a [NoSQL document store](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage).

With Kuzzle, customers **can directly access data stored in the database** as long as they have the rights to do so.

Kuzzle exposes the [Elasticsearch Query Language](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/querying) in a secure way. It is therefore possible to **take full advantage of the possibilities of Elasticsearch** with boolean queries, aggregations, special fields, etc.

The support of Elasticsearch 8 has been introduced in Kuzzle 2.30.0.

The choice has been made to keep Kuzzle compatible to avoid breaking changes around the support of ES8.

We wanted to allow the user to **opt-in** for this feature, so no modification is needed on your behalf if you want to keep using Elasticsearch 7.

The default major version of Elasticsearch will be 7 until Kuzzle v3.

The new configuration key to change the version supported is available under:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "storageEngine": {
      "majorVersion": 8
    }
  }
}
```

:::warning
You can not set the `majorVersion` key to 8 if you are using a version of Kuzzle that does not support it.
:::

:::info
Kuzzle cannot connect to both Elasticsearch 7 and Elasticsearch 8 at the same time.
:::

Once the version is set to 8, Kuzzle will use the Elasticsearch 8 API to communicate with the database.

You will find below an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file to run Kuzzle with Elasticsearch 8.

```yaml
services:
  node:
    image: kuzzleio/kuzzle:2
    depends_on:
      redis:
        condition: service_healthy
      elasticsearch:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "7512:7512"
      - "7511:7511"
      - "7510:7510"
      - "9229:9229"
      - "1883:1883"
    environment:
      - kuzzle_services__storageEngine__client__node=http://elasticsearch:9200
      - kuzzle_services__storageEngine__commonMapping__dynamic=true
      - kuzzle_services__internalCache__node__host=redis
      - kuzzle_services__memoryStorage__node__host=redis
      - NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV:-development}
      - DEBUG=${DEBUG:-none}
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:7512/_healthcheck"]
      timeout: 10s
      interval: 10s
      retries: 30
      start_period: 1m

  redis:
    image: redis:6
    ports:
      - '6379:6379'
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD', 'redis-cli', 'ping']
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 30

  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:8.11.3
    container_name: kuzzle_elasticsearch
    environment:
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
      - action.destructive_requires_name=false
      - cluster.name=kuzzle
      - node.name=alyx
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - ingest.geoip.downloader.enabled=false
      - indices.id_field_data.enabled=true
    ports:
      - '9200:9200'
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD', 'curl', '-f', 'http://localhost:9200']
      interval: 2s
      timeout: 2s
      retries: 10
    ulimits:
      nofile: 65536
```

Or you can run `kourou app:scaffold sandbox` to create a new Kuzzle project with a `docker-compose.yml` file that uses Elasticsearch 8.

## Inside a kuberenetes cluster

While running Kuzzle inside a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the following configuration to run Kuzzle with Elasticsearch 8:

```yaml
  # SSL/TLS Configuration
  - name: kuzzle_services__storageEngine__client__tls__ca
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: elasticsearch-master-certs
        key: ca.crt
  - name: kuzzle_services__storageEngine__client__tls__rejectUnauthorized
    value: "false"
  - name: kuzzle_services__storageEngine__client__tls__cert
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: elasticsearch-master-certs
        key: tls.crt
  - name: kuzzle_services__storageEngine__client__tls__key
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: elasticsearch-master-certs
        key: tls.key
```

This will allow Kuzzle to connect to Elasticsearch 8 using a secure connection.
